# Datacamp_Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
A Datacamp Project which evaluates a logistic regression of a model for predicting credir cards approvals, using supervised learning with python 

As the project gets done, we get a model accuracy of 100%. It is very rare to get a model score of 1.0 but the same datacamp project tells us it WILL have that perfect score. Subsequent to that step, we find the best values of the parameters 'tol' and 'max_iter' from the LogisticRegression model, using GridSearchCV.
